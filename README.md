Hey Jhon, I noticed that your daily step count has decreased significantly from 6000 steps to just 500 steps in the last week. I'm concerned about this change in your routine. Is there a reason why you've been walking less than usual? It's important to understand what might be causing this shift in your behavior. Let's try to figure out together what's going on. Are you feeling any different physically or emotionally lately that could be impacting your activity level?
