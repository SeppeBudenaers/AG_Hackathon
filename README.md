### Panick attack

```
Hi Jhon, I noticed that your vital signs have changed quite a bit in the last hour. Your heart rate has increased from 80 bpm to 120 bpm, your sweat production has also doubled from 500 ml to 1000 ml, and your breathing rate has gone up from 15 breaths per minute to 25 breaths per minute.

These changes in your vital signs could indicate that something is going on with your body or mind. It's important to try and understand the possible causes behind these changes.

Do you remember experiencing any sudden physical discomfort or distress in the past hour that could have caused these changes in your vital signs? Or did you have any sudden thoughts or feelings that might have triggered this response in your body?

It's essential to determine whether these changes are primarily physical or if they could be related to your mental or emotional state. This information will help us figure out the best course of action to ensure your well-being.

### Steps

Hey Jhon, I noticed that your daily step count has decreased significantly from 6000 steps to just 500 steps in the last week. I'm concerned about this change in your routine. Is there a reason why you've been walking less than usual? It's important to understand what might be causing this shift in your behavior. Let's try to figure out together what's going on. Are you feeling any different physically or emotionally lately that could be impacting your activity level?
